# Noe.css
I haven't finished the framework yet. Contribution is warmly welcomed.

Welcome everyone from *Noe.css*!

I would like to contribute this css framework.
I have built some of the main portions of the framework but I still have a lot of features to finish.
Grid Systems,Buttons,Colors and other features like tags,alerts,cards have finshed.

### Download
For front-end developer who would use **Noe.css** will have to download only Noe.css.
Other Scss files are meant for contributors and those who wolud like to give feedbacks upon codes.

**Hope for some feedbacks after using the framework**
